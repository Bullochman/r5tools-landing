**Owner:** Evan Jones · **Draft date:** 2026-07-17 · **Status:** Copy-paste-ready, awaiting budget approval

## 0. Guardrails + tracking prerequisites

Before spending a single dollar:

1. **UTM convention** — every ad URL uses:
   `https://r5tools.io/?utm_source={google|meta|twitter}&utm_medium={cpc|paid_social}&utm_campaign={campaign_id}&utm_content={ad_variant_id}`
2. **Google Ads conversion tracking** — install gtag on `r5tools.io` + fire a `paid_unlock` conversion on the `/unlock` success page (post-Stripe success redirect). Value = $10 (Personal) / $50 (Alliance) / $5 (Roster Premium).
3. **Meta Pixel** — install on landing + fire `Lead` on Access-Code claim, `Purchase` on Stripe success.
4. **Twitter/X conversion pixel** — same events, same value model.
5. **Do not run any ads until Access Codes deploy lands** (task #50). Ads driving to `mailto:` CTAs will burn budget with no attribution loop.

## 1. Google Ads campaign brief

### Campaign settings

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Campaign type | Search |
| Networks | Google Search only (turn OFF Display + Search Partners for test) |
| Bidding | Maximize Conversions with target CPA $8 |
| Daily budget | $50–100 recommended (start $50, scale if CPA holds) |
| Test duration | 30 days |
| Locations | US, KR, JP, DE, UK, CA, AU, PH, SG, TH, VN |
| Languages | English + Korean (separate ad groups by language) |
| Age | 18–45 |
| Devices | All (LWS is mobile-first — do NOT exclude mobile) |
| Ad rotation | Optimize for conversions |
| Ad schedule | 24/7 for first 14 days; narrow after data lands |

**Sanity check:** at target $8 CPA, $50/day → ~6 conv/day needed. At blended CVR ~4% that's ~150 clicks/day at ~$0.33 avg CPC. Realistic for long-tail LWS terms; tight for head terms.

### Google Ads landing page recommendations

1. **Dedicated LP variant per ad group** (optional v2) — `/?ag=ag1` renders headline tuned to the ad group's query intent.
2. **Above-the-fold**: current hero + WHY-R5s callout is solid; keep.
3. **Add Google Ads conversion pixel** to `/unlock` success page — value=10 (Personal), 50 (Alliance), 5 (Roster Premium). Fire on Stripe redirect landing.
4. **UTM persistence** — capture UTMs in localStorage on first page load and attach to Stripe checkout metadata so CVR by ad_variant is queryable in Stripe dashboard.
5. **Speed** — LP is a single static `index.html`, already <100ms TTFB from GH Pages. No optimization needed.

## 2. Meta Ads (Facebook + Instagram) — 5 creative drafts

### Meta creative 1 — Video ad (15s Roster Extractor demo)

**Format:** Vertical 9:16, 15 seconds, sound optional (captions burned in).

**Script + storyboard:**

| t | Visual | Caption (burned-in, bottom third) |
|---|---|---|
| 0.0–1.5s | Phone screen: "Alliance → Members" tab in LWS, R5 crown visible at top | "Your alliance has 94 members." |
| 1.5–4.5s | Slow thumb-scroll down the member list, ~3s total scroll | "Screen record it. That's it." |
| 4.5–6.0s | Cut to laptop: drag video file into r5tools.io/roster upload zone | "Drop the video. Two minutes later..." |
| 6.0–10.0s | Time-lapse: extractor progress bar → review table populates → sortable columns | "94 members. Ranks. HQ levels. Power." |
| 10.0–13.0s | Click "Download CSV" → CSV opens in Google Sheets, sorted by power desc | "CSV in your hands. Discord PNG too." |
| 13.0–15.0s | Full-screen end card: r5tools.io logo + "Try free: code RONY-FREE" | "r5tools.io · RONY-FREE" |

**Ad copy (post text):**

> Primary text: `Your R5 has been typing 94 names into a Google Sheet for two seasons. Stop. Record your member list, upload the video, get a sorted CSV in 2 minutes. First video free with code RONY-FREE.`
> Headline: `Roster CSV in 2 minutes`
> Description: `Built by an active R5. 7 languages. Free trial.`
> CTA button: `Try for Free`
> URL: `https://r5tools.io/?utm_source=meta&utm_medium=paid_social&utm_campaign=video_demo&utm_content=roster_15s`

### Meta creative 2 — Static image, pain-first hero

**Image:** Split-screen. Left half: cluttered Google Sheet screenshot with red misalignments, missing rows, "?" cells — labeled "Before". Right half: r5tools.io Roster Extractor review table, clean, sorted — labeled "After". Dark background matching r5tools.io palette (#0a0e1a + gold #c9a961).

**Copy:**

> Primary text: `The Google Sheet is killing your alliance. 94 members. Half the ranks wrong. Nobody knows who's actually the top rally leader. r5tools.io ships 8 planning tools built by an active R5. Free trial: RONY-FREE.`
> Headline: `Stop losing S2 to alliances with tools`
> Description: `$10 personal, $50 alliance-wide.`
> CTA: `Learn More`

### Meta creative 3 — Carousel (5 cards)

Each card 1080×1080, dark theme, one tool screenshot + one-line benefit.

| # | Screenshot | Headline | Body |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Roster Extractor review table | `Roster in 2 minutes` | `Video in, CSV out. Handles 94+ members.` |
| 2 | Landing Planner ring diagram | `Landing planned in 10 minutes` | `Rank-tier rings. Ministry warnings included.` |
| 3 | Heat Simulator concentric bands | `Season 2 freeze survival` | `Know who's at -20°C before Wk3 blizzards.` |
| 4 | Coal Burn Calculator chart | `L20 overdrive = 117k coal` | `Budget before Wk3. Not during.` |
| 5 | r5tools.io landing hero | `Try free: RONY-FREE` | `8 tools. 7 languages. One-time payment.` |

**Post copy (single):**
> `Eight planning tools your R5 doesn't have. Built by an active R5 for R5s. Free trial with code RONY-FREE — no card required.`
> CTA: `Learn More`
> URL: `https://r5tools.io/?utm_source=meta&utm_medium=paid_social&utm_campaign=carousel_tools&utm_content=5tool_walk`

### Meta creative 4 — Korean version of image ad

Same split-screen visual as Creative 2. All Korean copy.

**Copy (KR):**

> Primary text: `구글 시트로 얼라이언스를 관리하고 계신가요? 94명 멤버, 계급은 절반이 틀리고, 최고 랠리 리더가 누군지 아무도 모릅니다. r5tools.io는 현역 R5가 만든 8개의 계획 도구를 제공합니다. 무료 체험: RONY-FREE.`
> Headline: `도구 없는 얼라이언스에게 S2를 뺏기지 마세요`
> Description: `개인 $10, 얼라이언스 $50.`
> CTA: `자세히 알아보기`
> URL: `https://r5tools.io/?utm_source=meta&utm_medium=paid_social&utm_campaign=image_kr&utm_content=split_kr`

**Targeting:** KR + JP (Korean-diaspora + JP players who play in KR warzones), 18–45, interests include Last War: Survival + mobile strategy games.

### Meta creative 5 — Alliance leader testimonial (placeholder)

**Format:** Static image, testimonial layout, 1080×1350 Instagram Feed.

**Placeholder copy (to swap when we have a real testimonial):**

> `"We were losing our top 5 rally leaders to freeze in Wk3 every season. r5tools.io's Freeze Dashboard flagged every one of them 4 days ahead. Zero freeze-outs in S2."`
> — [Name], R5 of [Alliance], Warzone [####]
>
> CTA overlay: `Try free: RONY-FREE at r5tools.io`

**Placeholder ownership note:** Do NOT run this variant until we have a real quote + permission. Fake testimonials are a Meta policy violation AND terrible for brand.

---

## 3. Twitter / X ad drafts

### Twitter creative 1 — Screenshot + short hook

**Tweet:**
> `Your R5 has been typing 94 names into a Google Sheet for two seasons.`
>
> `Stop.`
>
> `Record → upload → CSV in 2 minutes. Then plan your S2 landing in 10.`
>
> `Free trial: code RONY-FREE`
>
> `r5tools.io`
>
> [Attached image: Roster Extractor review table screenshot, sorted by power]

**Promoted format:** Website Clicks objective. Target: interest keywords `Last War Survival, LWS, mobile strategy, alliance games, First Fun`. Followers of: `@FirstFunGames` + accounts of top LWS content creators.

### Twitter creative 2 — Video demo tweet

**Tweet:**
> `2 minutes. 94 members. Sorted CSV.`
>
> `This is what your alliance roster spreadsheet should feel like.`
>
> `Free trial with RONY-FREE.`
>
> `r5tools.io`
>
> [Attached video: same 15s Roster Extractor demo from Meta Creative 1]

**Promoted format:** Video Views + Website Clicks combo.

### Twitter creative 3 — Reply template (organic + boosted)

**Use case:** Reply to tweets mentioning LWS pain points (roster tracking, S2 planning, freeze issues, alliance coordination). Boost the reply as a Promoted Reply once it lands 5+ organic likes.

**Template A — Roster pain:**
> `We built r5tools.io specifically for this. Record your member list, upload, get a CSV in 2 minutes. Free trial with code RONY-FREE if you want to try it before the next season.`

**Template B — Freeze / S2 pain:**
> `The Freeze Risk Dashboard at r5tools.io flags this 4+ days ahead. Free with warzone 2007 code or code RONY-FREE for anyone else.`

**Template C — Google Sheet complaints:**
> `Same. That's why we shipped r5tools.io — one CSV upload, 8 planning tools consume it. Free trial: RONY-FREE.`

**Rules for using these:**
- Only reply to tweets where the pain-point is genuine and the tweeter is active (posted this week).
- NEVER reply to tweets from First Fun official accounts or LWS moderators.
- Max 3 reply-boosts per day. Twitter's spam detection flags patterns fast.
- Log every reply in `~/claudecode/r5tools/r5tools-landing/marketing/twitter-reply-log.csv` so we can measure conversion attribution.

## 4. Projected results — 30-day spreadsheet-ready table

Copy into a Google Sheet as-is.

```
Channel              | Est CPC | Daily Budget | Clicks/day | Est CVR | Signups/day | Est Revenue/day | 30d Revenue
Google Ads (US)      | $1.20   | $30          | 25         | 4%      | 1.0         | $22 (alliance)  | $660
Google Ads (KR)      | $0.60   | $20          | 33         | 6%      | 2.0         | $44 (alliance)  | $1,320
Google Ads (JP/DE/UK) | $1.00  | $15          | 15         | 3%      | 0.45        | $10 (alliance)  | $300
Meta (US)            | $2.50   | $30          | 12         | 3%      | 0.36        | $8 (alliance)   | $240
Meta (KR)            | $0.90   | $20          | 22         | 5%      | 1.1         | $24 (alliance)  | $720
Twitter (blended)    | $1.80   | $15          | 8          | 3%      | 0.24        | $5 (alliance)   | $150
                     |         |              |            |         |             |                 |
Total                |         | $130         | 115        | ~4.3%   | 5.15        | $113            | $3,390
```

### Revenue-mix assumptions

- Alliance $50 = 40% of conversions (heavy weighting because R5s are our target).
- Personal $10 = 45% of conversions.
- Roster Premium $5 = 15% of conversions (usually add-on to Personal).
- Blended per-signup value ≈ $22.

### 30-day revenue range

- **Pessimistic** (CVR at half projection, CPC 25% high): **~$1,700**
- **Baseline** (table above): **~$3,400**
- **Optimistic** (CVR 1.5×, CPC 15% low): **~$6,100**

At $130/day × 30 days = $3,900 ad spend. Baseline = **~$500 net loss on ad spend alone in month 1**, but LTV is $0 for now since we don't have subscription — this is a customer-acquisition test, not a payback-in-30-days test. Watch CPA at week 2 and either scale (CPA < $8) or pause (CPA > $15).

### Kill-switch triggers

- Pause any ad group with 100+ clicks and 0 conversions.
- Pause the whole campaign if blended CPA > $20 after 7 days.
- Pause + investigate if CVR > 10% (likely tracking pixel misfire, not real conversions).

## 5. Landing page A/B variants (hero copy)

Current hero is Variant A. Deploy Variant B + C as A/B via `?v=b` / `?v=c` query param — client-side swap at page load. Split 33/33/33 for 14 days.

**Variant A (current, control):**
> Headline: `Your alliance is planning Season 2 in a group chat`
> Sub: `Stop. Here are 8 tools that fix it.`

**Variant B (loss-aversion):**
> Headline: `Stop losing S2 to alliances with tools`
> Sub: `Get the tools. Free trial: code RONY-FREE.`

**Variant C (pain-first / spreadsheet):**
> Headline: `The Google Sheet is killing your alliance`
> Sub: `Try this instead. 8 tools, one CSV, ten minutes to plan a season.`

### A/B measurement

- Instrument each variant with `data-variant="A|B|C"` on hero + fire `hero_view` event with variant to GA4.
- Primary metric: click-through to Roster Extractor OR Access Code claim.
- Secondary metric: paid conversion in Stripe.
- 14 days, then pick the winner and set it as default; retire the other two.

---

## 6. Launch checklist

Before Evan approves budget:

- [ ] Access Codes deploy live at `access-codes.r5tools.io` (task #50)
- [ ] Stripe payment links replace all `mailto:` CTAs on r5tools.io
- [ ] Google Ads conversion pixel installed on `/unlock` success page
- [ ] Meta Pixel installed on landing + firing `Lead` + `Purchase`
- [ ] Twitter/X conversion pixel installed
- [ ] UTM persistence in localStorage → passed to Stripe checkout metadata
- [ ] A/B hero variants B + C shipped (client-side swap on `?v=` query)
- [ ] Twitter reply log CSV created + Evan agrees to reply cadence rules
- [ ] Video demo shot (15s Roster Extractor screen recording) — needed for Meta creative 1 + Twitter creative 2
- [ ] Split-screen Before/After image designed for Meta creative 2 + 4
- [ ] Final URLs QA'd — every UTM combination resolves 200 + fires pixel

Once all boxes checked → Evan sets budget in each platform, activates campaigns. Claude does not touch payment or bidding controls.
